# Datasets for RAG Benchmarking

You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Production-grade RAG requires rigorous
evaluation against ground-truth datasets. This list covers general-purpose
benchmarks and domain-specific corpora.

## The Leaderboards

Before choosing a model, check these live leaderboards:

- [MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)
  - The gold standard for choosing an embedding model (Retrieval, Clustering,
    Reranking quality).
- [Open Compass](https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-llm-v2)
  - Comprehensive LLM evaluation which includes retrieving capabilities.
- [Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard)
  - General LLM performance.
